Access for less secure apps has been turned on



Hi Nistreanu,
You recently changed your security settings so that your Google Account
testmailevozon@gmail.com is no longer protected by modern security
standards.

Please be aware that it is now easier for an attacker to break into your
account. You can make your account safer again by undoing this change here
<https://www.google.com/settings/security/lesssecureapps>, then switching
to apps made by Google such as Gmail to access your account.

now.

Best,
The Google Accounts team
